## Answers to Prompts
- **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
  Discussions about using ML algorithms such as GCNs for advancing cancer research have been really interesting. 

- **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
  We would like to improve the GCNMERGE model using RL mechanicms to enhance the sampling used in GraphSAGE, and use this model on ecDNA data to distinguish these chromatins from regular linear chromatin. 

- **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
  I will try to fully understand the data and the math behind the ML model I'm working with before starting to code. In quarter 1, I understood what I was supposed to do after coding for a couple weeks with no progress. I will try to avoid this and be more efficient in quarter 2. 

- **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
  I would like to add visual data as features to my model and use some sort of VLM on it, with the current data as metadata. But the lack of such data is an issue, and difficulty in getting acccess to such data if they exist, is a major issue.
